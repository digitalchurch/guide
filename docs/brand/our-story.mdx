# Our Story

This is the story of Digital Church. We believe that storytelling is one of the most powerful forms of communication, so we've placed it first in our brand playbook.

## BrandScript

The BrandScript is the story of our customers. These are the people we serve, the ones we guide into personal success.

### A Character

A Church Leader who wants to be more effective at online ministry.

### With A Problem

#### External

When you want to do online ministry, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the long list of things to do to get started. You want to build a system that you know works, but you are having trouble seeing the big picture.

#### Internal

Deep inside, you wonder if you will succeed. You understand the importance of it all, but the path forward seems too mysterious.

#### Philosophical

As the world becomes more digitally fluent, the church must keep up. This is a mission field that we've been called to serve.

### Meets a Guide Who Understands Their Fear

#### Empathy

Digital Church is our ministry. We want to empower churches with the clarity and tools they need to thrive in online ministry. We want to help build the Church Universal in the digital space.

#### Authority

The central hub of online ministry is the church website. We've been building church websites since 2014, building a platform with all the tools we needed to create the very best websites with church management tools working natively in the website. In addition to church websites, we've been helping churches scale with design services, ad management, social reputation, and email marketing so they can fully leverage the tools we've built.
