# Display a Form via a Modal Popup

Sometimes you might just want to have a button on your page that opens a form in a modal popup window. Using the PowerPack Modal Popup module, you can easily display a form. Here's how you'll do it.

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3STL2hZ1hK4"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
     />
</div>
