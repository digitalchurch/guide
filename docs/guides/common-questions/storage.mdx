# How much storage is available for my website?

We donâ€™t limit the amount of storage your website can use. Storage is unlimited. The only limitation is that the file you want to store must be smaller than 100MB. This should be large enough to cover any PDF or image file you want to use on your site. It will also allow you to upload any audio file that is properly encoded for podcasting. See our article on podcast encoding for more information. If you would like to use video on your website, we suggest that you upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo and then embed that video on your site. Those video servers will do a much better job of storing and serving your video content. Our page builder is integrated with these services as well, so all you need is the URL where the video is hosted.
