# Does Digital Church host Email Inboxes?

Digital Church does not host email. We believe that email is best hosted on a separate server from your website for security and performance reasons. As a result, we do not support or host email inboxes. There are several email services available, and we suggest that you consider the following:

## Google Workspace

[Google Workspace](https://workspace.google.com) is free for non-profit organizations who qualify for the [Google for Non-Profits](https://www.google.com/nonprofits/) program.

## Microsoft 365

[Microsoft 365](https://www.office.com) is a popular alternative to Google Workspace.

## Fastmail

At Digital Church, we use [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com). Fastmail is a privacy-focused alternative with enough openness to use with third party apps.

## Proton

If privacy is your top concern, [Proton](https://proton.me) is an option you should consider. Third-party apps may not always work with Protonmail, but it's the most secure option we are aware of.
