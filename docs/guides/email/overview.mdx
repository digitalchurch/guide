## Email Account Hosting

Digital Church **does not** host email accounts.

We’ve decided to keep all our focus and resources aimed at creating a great platform for websites. In order to keep that focus, we’ve decided to not host email accounts for our clients. We will, however, gladly assist you in setting up the DNS records needed to use a third-party email provider. Most of our clients choose Google G Suite to have a native gmail user experience. If you’d like some help setting up G Suite, we have some important links below:
