# Add a Form with the Dashboard Block Editor

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://vimeo.com/515880809"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
     />
</div>

Sometimes you need to add a form to a post you are editing with the block editor in the dashboard. The block editor is what it typically used for blog posts, sermons, connect cards, and other dynamic content types. (Pages are usually edited in the front-end Page Builder.) Here’s how you would add a new form to post content in the block editor.

1. Add a new block to your content using one of the methods below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mouse" label="Mouse" default>
    Click on the blue plus button in the block editor (either in the content or in the top left corner) and select "Form" as the block type.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="keyboard" label="Keyboard">
    While typing in the content area, type `/form` to insert a form block.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Once you’ve added the form block, you can select the correct form from the listing. (Note: You should create the form using the form editor in the dashboard first)
3. In the right sidebar, you’ll see some additional options, like the ability to hide/show the form title or description, enable, AJAX, or even add field values.
