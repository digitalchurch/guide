# Make a Specific Form Field Required

Sometimes you want to be sure that someone fills out a specific field on your forms. Luckily, you can easily set any field as a required field, and the user won’t be able to submit the form entry unless the required fields are all completed. Here’s how to set that up.

1. In the administrative dashboard, go to Forms and find the form you want to edit.
2. Hover over the field you want to make required and click on the settings button for that field.
3. Under the General tab of the field settings, you can check the box labeled Required. You’ll notice a red asterisk now appears next to the field title in the main field editor window.
4. Don’t forget to click on the Save Form button!

:::tip Always Test!
It’s a very good idea to run a test of your form any time you edit a form that is live on the front end of your website.
