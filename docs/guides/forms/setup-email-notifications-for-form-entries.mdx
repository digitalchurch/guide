# Setting up Email Notifications for Form Entries

Every time someone fills out a form, you can receive an email with the contents of the form entry. In fact, you can even use some advanced conditional logic to create rules like this:

> Email the Kid’s Ministry Director if the form entry says “Yes! I’m bringing my kids.”

But before we get into complicated form notifications, let’s set up a simple email notification for every form submission on a specific form.

## Basic Form Notifications

1. Login to the admin dashboard of your Digital Church account.
2. Hover over the form you want to work on, then hover over the Settings option
3. Click on Notifications. 
4. Now you should see a listing of existing notifications. Your form might already have one set up that you can edit, or you can add a new notification to the form. 
5. Now you can edit the notification details like who receives an email. be sure to set which email address the notification should go to and also be sure to add fields to the content of the notification email. 
6. You might want to use some merge tags, which you can access with the small dropdown button on the right side of the fields. For instance, \{admin_email\} will send the notification email to the site admin. In the notification content, \{all_fields\} will include a table with every field entry.
