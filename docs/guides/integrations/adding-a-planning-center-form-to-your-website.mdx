# Add a Planning Center Form to my Website

Planning Center does not allow us to embed their forms directly in the content of our websites and apps, however, they do provide a script to open it in a modal popup window. Hereâ€™s how you can do that:

1. Make sure the Planning Center integration is enabled on your website.
2. In your dashboard, visit the **Settings > Integrations** page and make sure the Planning Center integration is enabled. This will add the Planning Center script to your header.

:::note
You can also manually add the script into your `<head>` if you prefer.
:::

3. Add the Planning Center modal URL parameter to your link.
4. In the page builder or block editor, you can add a button, image, or text link to your form. At the end of the form URL, add `?open-in-church-center-modal=true` to the end of the URL.
5. Publish your post or page.

:::tip Always Test Your Changes!
Also, be sure to test your results in an incognito/private window.
