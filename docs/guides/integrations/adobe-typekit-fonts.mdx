# Using Adobe Typekit Fonts

If you have an active Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, you may want to use Adobe Typekit fonts on your website.

1. Copy your Adobe Typekit Project ID from your Adobe Typekit Account.
2. In your website dashboard, go to Design > Custom Fonts.
3. Add a title to your custom font (anything youâ€™d like it to be) and change the type to Adobe Type Kit.
4. Paste in your project ID and Publish your custom font.

Now that your custom font has been added, you should see it in the Global Options typography settings and in the page builder.
