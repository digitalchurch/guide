If you’d like to change the order that the connect cards appear on the connect page, it’s very easy to change the order in the dashboard. Access the connect cards in the dashboard using one of the methods below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard" default>
    In the dashboard menu, select connect cards.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command Menu">
    Use <code>⌘</code> + <code>K</code> to open the command bar and type "Edit Connect Cards" and hit return.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Click and drag the connect cards in the order you want them to appear.

Refresh your connect page to check the changes.

Thats it!

You can also customize the display in the page builder, so if you need to do something more complex, we can help you with that. Just shoot us a chat message anytime!
