# Shortcodes

We've custom coded several shortcodes that you can use around your site as you customize it. Shortcodes are simple text codes in square brackets that can display useful dynamic data.

## Popular Shortcodes

- **`[date]`** - Display current date/time, post dates, or custom formatted timestamps
- **`[search]`** - Add a search form for specific post types
- **`[team_members]`** - Display team member listings  
- **`[account]`**, **`[login]`**, **`[register]`** - User authentication forms

Explore the individual shortcode pages for detailed usage examples and parameters.
