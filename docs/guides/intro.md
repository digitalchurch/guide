⚡️ Digital Church will help you build a website or native application for your church in no time.

💸 Custom built websites and applications can be expensive and time consuming, so we've built systems to give you the tools you need at a more reasonable price.

💥 Ready for more? Use advanced features like our sermon manager, livestream integrations, giving integrations, and more.

💅 Check the best Digital Church sites for inspiration and read some testimonials.

🧐 Digital Church is built on a custom-tuned version of WordPress. We use industry-leading hosting providers and plugins along with our own custom-coded solutions to provide an experience that is superior to what you can find elsewhere.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site** at digitalchurch.app.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Digital Church site using the **City Church Template**. Your website will be available at a subdomain (ie. yourname.digitalchurch.app) so you can take the time to build it out. You can also ask our team to migrate your current website content for free, or you can hire us to build your site for you. We'll be glad to help however we can.
