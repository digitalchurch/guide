# Submit your Podcast Feed to Apple Podcasts for Syndication

To get started, let’s make sure your podcast feed is properly set up. We’ll preview the feed in your web browser before we submit the feed to Apple.

1. Your podcast feed should be at this address: your.digitalchurch.app/feed/podcast
2. Validate your podcast feed using the Podbase Podcast vaildator: https://podba.se/validate/?url=your.digitalchurch.app/feed/podcast
3. You should see your podcast description and cover image on this page. If not, go to your podcast settings page and make sure you have a cover photo set and a show description entered. That page can be found at your.digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=podcast&page=podcast_settings
4. Once you have verified that your feed looks correct, you can submit it to apple via iTunes Connect.
