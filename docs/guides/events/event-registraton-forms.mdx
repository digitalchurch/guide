# Add a Registration Form to Your Event

Sometimes you need to add a registration form to your event. With our native form builder, you can already do that.

Create a Registration Form

In the administrative section, go to Forms > New Form which should take you here: your.digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/admin.php?page=gf_new_form
Drag field from the right column into the main section and configure as needed. You’ll probably want a name and email address and some additional information.
When you have the form set the way you’d like, you might want to edit how email notifications are sent when a form is completed. That can be done in Forms > Your New Registration Form > Settings > Notifications.
Add the Form to your Event

Once you’ve created the registration form and the event post, edit that event.
Above the description area, you’ll see a button to Add Form. Press that and select your form.
That button will insert your form into your event description. You can put it above, below, or in the middle of any description content you add.
Any time you set up a form, you should run some test entries to make sure all the notifications are being delivered. If you run into any issues, let us know. We’d love to help!
