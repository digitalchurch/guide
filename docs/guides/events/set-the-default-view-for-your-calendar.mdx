# Set the Default View for Your Calendar

When you have a lot of calendar events added to your website, it might make sense to change the default view from a list of upcoming events to a traditional monthly calendar view. Luckily, we’ve made that pretty easy to do. Here’s how…

1. In your Dashboard, visit the Settings > Events page: your.digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tribe_events&page=tribe-common
2. Visit the Display tab: your.digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/edit.php?page=tribe-common&tab=display&post_type=tribe_events
3. Scroll down to Default view and select your desired view.
4. Don’t forget to save your changes and check your events page to make sure it looks like you wanted it to.
