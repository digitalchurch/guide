# Display Only the Next Recurring Event on your Calendar

![Display the Next Recurring Event Only](./img/display-next-recurring-event-only.jpg)

In list views of the calendar, there may be times when you want to condense the list by only showing the next occurance of a recurring event series. Luckily, that's possible with a simple setting in the dashboard.

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Events > Settings**
    ```html
    https://your-subdomain.digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=tribe_events&page=tec-events-settings&tab=general
    ```
2. Select the option that reads "Show only the next event in each Series (only affects list-style views)."
3. Scroll down and press the **Save Changes** button.
