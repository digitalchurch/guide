# Add a New Team

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://vimeo.com/1009254904"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}

</div>

## 1. Create a new Team

Navigate to **Dashboard > Teams > Add New** to create a new team. Give the team a title and description (if you'd like to add a description) and then add any relevant information you might want to show out on the team page.

## 2. Add Team Members

Once you've added your team members as people first, you can then create roles and add people to each role to set them as team members.

## 3. Display Team Members via Shortcode

On the front end of the website, you may want to display the team members. You can use the `[team_members team_id=""]` shortcode to display the team members.
