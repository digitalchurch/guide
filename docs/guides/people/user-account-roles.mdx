title: User Account Roles
---

There are a number of roles that are available on your website. If you are logged into the user account that was set up when you started your website, you should have the role of Administrator. Here’s an overview of the roles that are available:

## Default Roles:

**Administrator:** Somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.

**Editor:** Somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.

**Author:** Somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.

**Contributor:** Somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.

**Subscriber:** Somebody who can only manage their profile.

In addition to the roles that are available in our core installation, there are some roles that are added when specific plugins are active, such as `student` or `instructor` when Online Learning is active.

By default, new users are assigned the Subscriber  role. They won’t have access to the administrative dashboard, but they will be able to use the online community tools to manage their own profile.

## Setting Permissions for Users

In some cases, you might want to promote a user from Subscriber to Editor (or some other role). In order to do that, visit the People tab in the dashboard and do the following:

1. Check the select box to the left of the user(s) you would like to promote.
2. Click on the “Change Role to…” dropdown box and select the role you would like to assign to the selected users.
3. Click on the “Change” button next to that dropdown.

:::note
If you would like to have an account promoted to ‘Administrator’, we ask that you submit a chat request via the onsite chat and have one of our team members make that change for you. This helps to ensure that your account stays secure, as anyone logged into an administrator account could make changes that you might not want made.
