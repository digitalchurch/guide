This video tutorial will walk you through the process of adding a new user account to the system.

### 1. Go to the User Accounts Page

In your dashboard, go to the **People** section and click on **All Users**. Check to make sure you don't already have a user account set up for the person you want to add.

### 2. Click on the **Add New User** Button

Click on the **Add User** button to add a new user account. Enter the person's username, Name, and Email address. Check the box that says **Send Email Invitation** to send an email invitation to the person to create their password. Be sure you have the user role set to the level of permissions you want them to have. You can reference the [User Roles](./user-account-roles) guide for more information about roles and capabilities.

### 3. Click on the **Save** Button

Click on the **Save** button to save the new user account.

### 4. Send the Email Invitation

If you checked the box to send an email invitation, the person will receive an email with a link to create their password.
