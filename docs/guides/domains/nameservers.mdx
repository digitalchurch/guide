# Nameservers

Nameservers are the top-level of DNS that tells the world where to find the rest of the DNS records for your domain. When it's time to launch your Digital Church website, you'll be asked to change your nameservers so we can manage your DNS records for you. This keeps the domain registration in your complete control, but allows us to take care of all the technical stuff for you while helping us to respond quickly if the server your website is on has issues that we need to address.
