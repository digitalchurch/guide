# DNS Records

Our team will set up your DNS records using Cloudflare. We can fully manage your DNS for in our own Cloudflare account, or you may set up a Cloudflare account and [invite our team to access your domain](https://digitalchurch.guide/guides/domains/cloudflare-invitation). Our IP Address changes often so you CANNOT use Digital Church without granting us ongoing access to your domain DNS records.
