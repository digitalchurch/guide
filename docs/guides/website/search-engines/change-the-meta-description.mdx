# Change Your Search Engine Meta Description

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://vimeo.com/1038727828"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
     />
</div>

If you would like to control the description that shows up for your website in search results, you can set the "Search Engine Meta Description" for your page. The home page is the most important, but you can do this for each page on your site. 

### 1. Edit the Page

If you are currently viewing the page you'd like to edit, just hover over the settings icon in the top right corner of the admin toolbar and select "Edit Page Settings". This should take you to the dashboard editor for the page.

### 2. Change the SEO Meta Description

Scroll down below the main content area for the editor and you should find an **SEO** settings area. Under the **Titles Settings** tab, you can set the Title and Meta Description how you want it to appear in search results. You'll see a preview of the search snippet to the right, and the fields will help guide you on how many characters are suggested for each.

### 3. Save your Changes

Be sure to save your changes. It will take a few hours or possibly a few days for the changes to show up in Google and other search engine results.

:::note
Search Engines do not always respect the changes you make on your website meta descriptions. They can use their own AI tools to decide what your description should be, however, if you've taken the time to set a custom description, it is usually respected by most search engines.
