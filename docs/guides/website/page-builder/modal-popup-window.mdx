# Add a modal popup window

You can add a modal popup window to any page with the page builder.

1. Launch the page builder using the button at the top left of the site when viewing the page you want to add the modal popup window to.
2. Change the module set to “Advanced Modules”
3. Find the Modal Popup module near the bottom of that list and drag it into the page.
4. On the Display Settings tab of the modal popup settings, you can select your trigger. Let’s use a button. You can edit the style of the button with the settings below that field.
5. On the Content tab, you can add your own content, including a form shortcode or a saved page builder template.
