# Build a Page Using the Page Builder

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://youtu.be/p5fGV1H7m9E"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
     />
</div>

## Create a New Page

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="dashboard" label="Dashboard" default>
    In the dashboard menu, select Pages. Then use the <b>Add New</b> button at the top of the pages listing.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="toolbar" label="Toolbar">
    Hover over the <b>+ New</b> item in the toolbar and select <b>Page</b>.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="command" label="Command Menu">
    Use <code>âŒ˜</code> + <code>K</code> to open the command bar and type "New Page" and hit return.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup the Page Title & Featured Image

Type a title into the Add a Title field. Then in the right column, click on the "Add a Featured Image" to set the featured image.

## Click on the "Launch Page Builder" button.

Once you click on the "Launch Page Builder" button, your changes will be saved and then you will be redirected to the frontend of the site where the page builder interface will load the page you would like to edit.

## Adding Modules to Your Page

In the top right corner, click on the + icon and you'll find modules, rows (with column layouts), templates, and saved elements that you can click and drag into the page. The page builder will automatically generate rows and columns based on where you drag the elements.

## What if the Page Builder isn't Working?

If you have trouble with the page builder on a specific page, it is likely that you've added some javascript to the page that is conflicting with the page builder. Add `&safemode` to your URL in the page builder and it will reload the page builder in safe mode, disabling the javascript that is causing the issue.
