# Generate a QR Code for your Website

Often, when people start hunting down a way to generate a QR code for their website, they end up paying for some redirect service or app that includes click tracking. Fortunately, none of that is necessary if you just want a QR code. In fact, it’s really easy and free to generate one for ANY website URL in Google Chrome.
