# Launching Your Site

When you are ready to launch your website, visit [digitalchurch.com/launch](https://digitalchurch.com/launch) and complete our launch request form. Our team will review your domain and DNS settings and launch your website as quickly as possible.

## Purchase a domain

If you don't already own a domain you can purchase a domain from any provider. We believe that it is vitally important for our clients to own their own domain. We recommend using [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/).

## DNS Records

Our team will set up your DNS records using Cloudflare. We can fully manage your DNS for in our own Cloudflare account, or you may set up a Cloudflare account and [invite our team to access your domain](https://digitalchurch.guide/guides/domains/cloudflare-invitation). Our IP Address changes often so you CANNOT use Digital Church without granting us ongoing access to your domain DNS records.

For more information on DNS records, see [DNS Records](https://digitalchurch.guide/guides/domains/dns-records).

## Cloning your site

Our team will clone your site over to your new domain. Once the site is cloned, you will be able to access it at your new domain. We will delete the staging site after the clone is complete.

:::note
Sites can take up to 48 hours for the changes to work their way through the system. Open a chat with us if you have any questions and we will be able to assist you.
