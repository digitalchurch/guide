# Launching Your Site

When you are ready to launch your website, visit [digitalchurch.com/launch](https://digitalchurch.com/launch) and complete our launch request form. Our team will review your domain and DNS settings and launch your website as quickly as possible.

## Purchase a domain

If you don’t already own a domain you can purchase a domain from any provider. We believe that it is vitally important for our clients to own their own domain. We recommend Google Domains. If you use Google Domains, you’ll be able to easily grant access to us to manage your domain settings without giving us your own Google credentials.

## DNS Records

Our team will set up your DNS records using Cloudflare. We can fully manage your DNS for in our own Cloudflare account, or you may set up a Cloudflare account and [invite our team to access your domain](https://digitalchurch.guide/guides/domains/cloudflare-invitation). Our IP Address changes often so you CANNOT use Digital Church without granting us ongoing access to your domain DNS records.

### Records we will set

| Type | Name | Target | TTL | Proxy Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | @ | {ip address} | Auto | DNS Only (Grey Cloud) |
| A | staging | {ip address} | Auto | DNS Only (Grey Cloud) |
| CNAME | www | @ | Auto | DNS Only (Grey Cloud) |

## Setting up your CloudFlare SSL Edge Certificate

Once you’ve set up your DNS records, visit the SSL/TLS tab of your CloudFlare account and set Your SSL/TLS encryption mode to Full (strict).
