# Change the Site Icon

The site icon (also known as the *favicon*) is the small icon that shows up in the browser tabs when viewing your website. If you don't have a site icon set, you might see the Digital Church logo show up by default. If you'd like to use your own site icon, follow the instructions below.

In the Global Options for your website, you can change the site icon (also called a favicon).

## Access the Global Options
