# Set a Different Logo for Transparent Headers

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://vimeo.com/471082006"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}
    playing={true}

Often times, we might use a full color logo over a white header background as the primary header on a website. Those color logos don’t look good with video or photo backgrounds, though, so when you have a transparent header, it’s common to want a plain white version of the logo. This guide will explain the steps needed to set a different logo for your transparent header.

1. In the top right corner of your website, hover over the settings menu, then click on Global Options.
2. Once the global options area loads, navigate to Header > Transparent Header
3. Click on Enable Transparent Header (You can apply it globally to the whole site while you set the logo, then off again if you’d like to manage that on a page-by-page basis).
4. Click on Use Different Logo for Transparent Header
5. Click on Upload and set your logo.
