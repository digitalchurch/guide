# Hide the Header Logo on a Specific Page

Sometimes you want to hide the header logo on a specific page. You can do that with custom CSS code. To apply the CSS to a specific page, we will use the page builder layout settings.

1. Launch the page builder on the page you’d like to edit.
2. In the top left corner, click on the dropdown menu and select “Layout CSS & Javascript”
3. In the CSS tab, paste the following code:

```css
.site-branding {
    display:none;
}
```

That’s it! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to our team via chat.
