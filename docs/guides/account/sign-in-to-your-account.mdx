## Troubleshooting Login Issues

If you are experiencing issues with login, you may need to clear your cache and cookies on your local machine. The types of issues that can sometimes occur are:

- The login page just refreshes when I sign in.

- The admin toolbar isn’t showing up after signing in.
- The login sends me to the wrong site after sign in.
- The login link doesn’t send me to a page where I can sign in.
