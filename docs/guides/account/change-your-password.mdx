Digital Church doesn't have access to view your password for you. Passwords are fully encrypted, so they are secure for you and you alone. So if you forget your password, you may need to reset it.

## When You Are Not Logged In

If you aren't logged into the site, then you can request a secure password reset link via email by putting your email address in the field on the password reset page. You can generally find that page by adding /password to the end of your domain URL.

## When You Are Logged In

### 1. Navigate to the profile page in your dashboard. It should be something like https://yourdigital.church/wp-admin/profile.php

### 2. Scroll down to the Account Management section and click the "Set New Password" button.

### 3. Copy your new secure password or type your own in the box.

### 4. Click the "Update User" button.

You might want to take a moment to log out and back in just to make sure your changes were saved.
