We are working on writing our own guides for this section. In the meantime, this video series from the makers of Perfmatters and Kyle Deusen at The Admin Bar is a primary reference for us.

### Quick Notes

- Server response time (TTFB), including HTML doc size has a huge impact on LCP. The further the distance, the more it matters. Don’t skip this! See previous video on TTFB, caching, etc.
- Get LCP under 2.5 seconds or less. Remember, Google uses throttled 4G mobile connection.
- Minify your JS and CSS.
- Remove unused CSS.
- Delay unused JS until it’s needed on user interaction.
- Defer JS to help eliminate render-blocking resources and avoid chaining critical requests.
- Host your fonts locally, add swap, and preload them.
- Decrease any large resources. Image optimization, fixing large font libraries, etc.
- Lazy load any images below the fold.
- Preload your LCP image and make sure to exclude images above the fold from lazy loading. You can also use fetch priority.
- Disable JS/CSS and or entire plugins from loading where they shouldn’t with a tool like the Script Manager.
- Take advantage of speculative loading techniques.

### Lazy loading

As a default, enable lazy loading and set it to ignore the first two images on each page so it doesn't lazy load above the fold.

- Images: true
- Exclude Leading Images: 2
- iFrames and Videos: true
- YouTube Preview Thumbnails: true
- Exclude from Lazy Loading:
```
id="livestream"
class="no-lazy"
```
- Threshold: 240px
- DOM Monitoring: false
- Add Missing Image Dimensions: true
- Fade In: true
- CSS Background Images: true
- Background Selectors:
```
.fl-row-content-wrap
.fl-col-content
```

### Minify CSS & JS

Go ahead any minify CSS and JS in perfmatters. This rarely causes any issues.

### Reduce Unused CSS

- Enable Reduce Unused CSS
- Set the type to **File**.
- Stylesheet behavior: Delay

### Delay JS

Go ahead and delay all scripts. Use the quick exclusions like GRavity Forms and Kadence Menu.

### Defer Javascript

This helps with Eliminate Render Blocking Resources.
