# Typography

We have several typography classes available to help you style your content. They are divided into a few different groups based on their purpose.

## Display

Display fonts are larger and more decorative than typical body fonts. They are commonly used on static pages and landing pages. You can create an entire section of display content using a class in any of the parents. for instance:

```html
<div class="display">
  <h1>Display Headline</h1>
  <p>Display paragraph</p>
</div>
```

## Article

Article fonts are typically used for blog posts, articles, and other long-form content. They are designed to be easy to read and are often used in conjunction with the body font. You can create an entire section of article content using a class in any of the parents. for instance:

```html
<div class="article">
  <h1>Article Headline</h1>
  <p>Article paragraph</p>
</div>
```

## User Interface 

User Interface fonts are used for cards, lists, and gallerys that feature posts. They are designed to be easy to read and are often used in conjunction with the body font. You can create an entire section of user interface content using a class in any of the parents. for instance:

```html
<div class="ui">
  <h1>User Interface Headline</h1>
  <p>User Interface paragraph</p>
</div>
```
